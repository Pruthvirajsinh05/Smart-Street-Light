# Smart Street Light System

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Smart Street Light System** is an energy-efficient lighting solution that automatically adjusts brightness based on ambient light and motion detection. It reduces power consumption by turning lights ON only when needed and dimming or turning them OFF when there is no activity.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Automatic ON/OFF based on day/night detection (LDR sensor)
- Motion-based brightness control (PIR/IR sensor)
- Energy-efficient LED lights
- Microcontroller-based automation (Arduino, NodeMCU, or similar)
- Low maintenance and long lifespan

---

## 🔧 Components Used
- Arduino / NodeMCU microcontroller
- Light Dependent Resistor (LDR)
- PIR / IR motion sensor
- LED street lights
- Resistors, wires, and breadboard
- Power supply

---

## ⚙️ Working Principle
1. **Daytime:** The LDR detects high light levels and keeps the street lights OFF.
2. **Nighttime (No Motion):** Lights stay in dim mode to save energy.
3. **Nighttime (With Motion):** When motion is detected by the PIR/IR sensor, lights switch to full brightness for a set duration.
4. Lights automatically return to dim mode after inactivity.
